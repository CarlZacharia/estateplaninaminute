# Last Will and Testament Review Skill

This skill analyzes existing Wills for Pennsylvania and Florida jurisdictions, compares them against client intake forms, and identifies issues or deficiencies.

## Core Review Workflow

### 1. Document Identification

Extract from the Will:

- **Execution date**: When was the Will signed?
- **Jurisdiction**: What state law governs? (Look for recitals, governing law clause, attestation clause language, testator's address)
- **Testator information**: Full legal name, address at execution
- **Document type**: Simple Will, Pour-Over Will, Codicil

**Jurisdiction Indicators**:
- Explicit governing law statement
- Testator's stated domicile/residence
- Attorney/law firm location in document
- Statutory references in attestation clause
- Language patterns (e.g., "Personal Representative" suggests FL; "Executor" is used in both but more common in PA)

### 2. Core Provisions Extraction

**Personal Representative/Executor**:
- Primary named
- Successor(s) named
- Bond waived? (standard practice—absence is a yellow flag)
- Powers granted (sale of property, continue business, invest, etc.)
- Compensation provisions

**Beneficiaries**:
- Specific bequests (who gets what specific items/amounts)
- Residuary beneficiaries (who gets the rest)
- Contingent beneficiaries (if primary predeceases)
- Distribution method: per stirpes vs. per capita vs. by representation
- Any disinheritance clauses

**Guardian Provisions** (if minor children):
- Guardian of the person named
- Guardian of the property/estate named
- Successor guardians
- Any restrictions or guidance for guardian

**Trust Provisions**:
- Testamentary trusts created within the Will?
- Pour-over to existing revocable trust?
- Trustee named and successors
- Trust terms (age for distribution, standards for discretionary distributions)

**Other Provisions**:
- Funeral/burial instructions
- Digital asset provisions
- Pet care provisions
- No-contest/in terrorem clause
- Tax apportionment clause
- Simultaneous death provisions

### 3. State-Specific Compliance Check

**Reference**: Apply the appropriate state requirements from:
- [references/pa_will_requirements.md](references/pa_will_requirements.md)
- [references/fl_will_requirements.md](references/fl_will_requirements.md)

#### Pennsylvania Quick Reference (20 Pa.C.S. § 2502)

**Execution Requirements**:
- ✓ In writing (typed or handwritten)
- ✓ Signed by testator at the END of the document
- ✓ Testator 18+ years of age
- ✓ Testator of sound mind
- ✗ Witnesses at execution NOT required (unless signed by mark)
- ✗ Notarization NOT required

**Critical PA Distinctions**:
- Pennsylvania does NOT require witnesses at execution (unique among states)
- Handwritten (holographic) wills ARE valid—same requirements as typed wills
- A beneficiary CAN serve as a witness without voiding their gift
- If testator signs by MARK (not signature), then two witnesses ARE required at execution
- At probate, two witnesses must prove the testator's signature (§ 3132)
- Self-proving affidavit (§ 3132.1) expedites probate but is not required
- Anything written AFTER the signature is not part of the Will

**PA Execution Checklist**:
- [ ] Document is in writing
- [ ] Testator's signature appears at the END
- [ ] If signed by mark: two witnesses present at execution
- [ ] Self-proving affidavit attached (recommended, not required)

#### Florida Quick Reference (F.S. § 732.502)

**Execution Requirements**:
- ✓ In writing
- ✓ Signed by testator at the END (or by another at testator's direction, in testator's presence)
- ✓ Testator 18+ years of age
- ✓ Testator of sound mind
- ✓ **Two attesting witnesses REQUIRED at execution**
- ✓ Witnesses must sign in presence of testator AND each other
- ✗ Notarization NOT required for validity

**Critical FL Distinctions**:
- Florida does NOT recognize holographic (unwitnessed handwritten) wills for FL domiciliaries
- Two witnesses must sign in the presence of the testator AND in the presence of each other (the "conscious presence" requirement)
- An interested witness (beneficiary) may void their gift if they are one of only two witnesses
- Self-proving affidavit (§ 732.503) strongly recommended—requires notarization
- Military testamentary instruments under 10 U.S.C. § 1044d are valid
- A handwritten will that IS properly witnessed is NOT considered holographic
- Non-resident's holographic will may be valid if valid where executed (§ 732.502(2))

**FL Execution Checklist**:
- [ ] Document is in writing
- [ ] Testator's signature appears at the END
- [ ] Two witness signatures present
- [ ] Attestation clause confirms witnesses signed in presence of testator
- [ ] Attestation clause confirms witnesses signed in presence of each other
- [ ] Self-proving affidavit attached with notary signature (recommended)
- [ ] No beneficiary is sole witness (check for interested witness issues)

### 4. Intake Form Comparison

When a client intake form is provided, systematically compare:

**Family Members Coverage**:
- [ ] All children mentioned in intake are addressed in Will (by name or class gift)
- [ ] Spouse (if any) is addressed appropriately
- [ ] Any intentionally disinherited persons explicitly excluded
- [ ] Deceased family members' shares addressed (per stirpes/contingent provisions)
- [ ] Step-children addressed if indicated in intake
- [ ] Grandchildren addressed if indicated in intake

**Assets Coverage**:
- [ ] Real property addressed (specific devise or residuary)
- [ ] Business interests addressed (special provisions for closely-held entities)
- [ ] Unique/valuable personal property addressed (jewelry, art, collections)
- [ ] Digital assets mentioned (if in intake)
- [ ] Retirement accounts—note these pass by beneficiary designation, not Will

**Fiduciary Appointments**:
- [ ] Executor/PR matches client's current preference from intake
- [ ] Guardian matches client's current preference (if applicable)
- [ ] Trustee matches (if testamentary trust exists)
- [ ] Successor fiduciaries match current preferences

**Discrepancies to Flag**:
- Names in Will don't match current family status (marriage, divorce, births, deaths)
- Missing beneficiaries identified in intake
- Executor/Guardian named is now deceased, incapacitated, or estranged
- Property specifically devised is no longer owned by testator
- Outdated address suggesting possible domicile change (jurisdiction issue)
- New children born after Will execution (pretermitted heir concern)
- Marriage or divorce after Will execution (revocation/modification by operation of law)

### 5. Common Deficiencies to Identify

#### Execution Defects

**Pennsylvania**:
- Missing testator signature
- Signature not at END of document (text after signature is invalid)
- If signed by mark: missing two witnesses
- Missing self-proving affidavit (not fatal but causes delay at probate)

**Florida**:
- Missing testator signature
- Signature not at END of document
- Only one witness (need two)
- Witnesses did not sign in presence of each other (attestation clause should confirm)
- Witnesses did not sign in presence of testator
- Interested witness without additional disinterested witnesses (gift may be voided)
- Missing self-proving affidavit (not fatal but causes delay)
- Holographic will by FL domiciliary (INVALID)

#### Drafting Issues

- Ambiguous beneficiary descriptions ("my children" without naming—what about adopted, step, posthumous?)
- Missing residuary clause (causes partial intestacy for unlisted assets)
- No contingent beneficiaries (what if primary predeceases or disclaims?)
- Conflicting provisions within the document
- Missing or inadequate executor powers
- No bond waiver (unnecessary expense to estate)
- No survivorship period (e.g., "survive me by 30 days")
- Missing simultaneous death provision
- Outdated tax planning provisions (estate tax exemption changes)
- Specific bequests of property no longer owned (ademption)

#### Staleness Issues

- Executed more than 5 years ago—recommend review
- Executed more than 10 years ago—strongly recommend review
- Pre-dates major life events:
  - Marriage (may be partially revoked by operation of law)
  - Divorce (provisions for ex-spouse typically voided by statute)
  - Birth/adoption of children (pretermitted heir statutes may apply)
  - Death of named beneficiary or fiduciary
- References persons now deceased as fiduciaries
- References property no longer owned
- Different state of domicile than current (may need new Will or confirmation of validity)
- References outdated law (e.g., old estate tax thresholds)

#### Coordination Issues

- Will references pour-over trust that may not exist or may be unfunded
- Will nominates guardian but no standalone guardian nomination exists
- No coordinating power of attorney or healthcare directive mentioned
- Retirement account beneficiary designations may conflict with Will provisions
- Life insurance beneficiary designations may conflict with Will provisions

### ADDITIONAL NOTES

[Any other observations, context, or recommendations not covered above]
```

### 7. Quality Standards

- Always identify jurisdiction BEFORE applying state-specific rules
- Flag uncertainty rather than assume (e.g., "signature appears to be present" vs. "signature confirmed")
- Distinguish between fatal defects and curable/minor issues
- Note if document quality prevents full analysis (poor scan, missing pages, illegible sections)
- Cross-reference the appropriate state requirements file
- When comparing to intake, note items that CANNOT be determined from the Will alone
- Never provide legal advice—provide analysis for attorney review
- Flag potential malpractice issues diplomatically (e.g., "execution may not comply with statutory requirements")

### 8. Special Situations

**Will Executed in Different State Than Current Domicile**:
- Check if Will complies with EITHER execution state OR current domicile state
- Pennsylvania: § 2504.1 validates wills compliant with execution state law
- Florida: § 732.502(2) validates non-holographic wills valid where executed
- Flag for attorney review regarding potential re-execution

**Pour-Over Will**:
- Verify referenced trust is identified by name and date
- Note that trust should be reviewed separately
- Check for "unfunded trust" risk if pour-over is sole disposition

**Joint or Mutual Wills**:
- Identify if Will is part of reciprocal arrangement
- Note potential contract issues if one spouse has died
- Flag for careful review before modification

**Will with Codicils**:
- Review all codicils in conjunction with original Will
- Check each codicil for proper execution
- Note any superseded provisions
- Consider whether consolidation into new Will is advisable
